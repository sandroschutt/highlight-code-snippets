== Usage ==
After activating the plugin, create a new post or page and give it a "code" tag. Using the Gutenberg block editor, select the Highlight Code Snippets block.

Define a title, programming language syntax and paste your code into the block. You're done! Chek your frontend out for results.

The block will not work if the "code" tag is missing from the page or post. You only will be able to update your page/post after defining a title and clicking the Save button.

"installation." Arbitrary sections will be shown below the built-in sections outlined above.
